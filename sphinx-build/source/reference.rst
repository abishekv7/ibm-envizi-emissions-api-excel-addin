This section describes all available custom functions provided by IBM Envizi for Excel.

Each function calls the IBM Envizi Emissions API from Excel to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on provided inputs.

General Notes
-------------

- All functions must be entered directly into Excel cells.
- Arguments in square brackets (``[ ]``) are optional.
- Errors are returned as Excel error messages.
- Units must follow the supported unit conventions defined in Envizi.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: none

   =ENVIZI.RECOMMEND_ACTIVITY_TYPE(search, country, [stateProvince], [date])

**Parameters**

- ``search`` – Text description of the activity (e.g., "electricity consumption", "diesel fuel", "air travel")
- ``country`` – ISO alpha-3 country code
- ``stateProvince`` *(optional)* – Geographic state or province
- ``date`` *(optional)* – Activity date (format: YYYY-MM-DD or Excel date)

**Outputs**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Column
     - Description
   * - ``Recommended Activity Type``
     - The AI-recommended activity type that best matches your description
   * - ``Confidence(%)``
     - Confidence level of the recommendation (0-100). Higher values indicate stronger matches.
   * - ``Description``
     - Detailed description of the recommended activity type

**Examples**

.. code-block:: none

   =ENVIZI.RECOMMEND_ACTIVITY_TYPE("electricity usage", "USA")
   =ENVIZI.RECOMMEND_ACTIVITY_TYPE("diesel fuel for trucks", "GBR", "England", "2024-01-15")
   =ENVIZI.RECOMMEND_ACTIVITY_TYPE("natural gas heating", "CAN", "Ontario")

**Usage Tips**

- Use descriptive text in the ``search`` parameter for better recommendations
- The function returns only the top recommendation (highest confidence)
- Use the recommended activity type in your emission calculation functions
- Combine with ``ENVIZI.HEADERS`` using ``includeDataTypeRecommender=TRUE`` to create templates that include recommendation columns

**Workflow Example**

1. Use ``ENVIZI.RECOMMEND_ACTIVITY_TYPE`` to get activity type suggestions
2. Review the confidence level and description
3. Use the recommended activity type in functions like ``ENVIZI.LOCATION``, ``ENVIZI.STATIONARY``, etc.

---

Headers
~~~~~~~

Returns the input or output column headers for a specific endpoint. Useful for setting up spreadsheet templates.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: none

   =ENVIZI.HEADERS([functionName], [input], [includeDataTypeRecommender])

**Parameters**

- ``functionName`` *(optional)* – Endpoint name (location, stationary, fugitive, mobile, transportation_and_distribution, calculation, economic_activity, real_estate, factor, factor_search, recommend_activity_type). Default: calculation
- ``input`` *(optional)* – TRUE for input headers, FALSE for output headers. Default: FALSE
- ``includeDataTypeRecommender`` *(optional)* – TRUE to include AI-recommended activity type columns in input headers (adds "Recommended Activity Type", "Confidence(%)", and "Description" after "Activity Type"). Only applies when input=TRUE. Default: FALSE

**Examples**

.. code-block:: none

   =ENVIZI.HEADERS()                                    // Returns output headers for calculation endpoint
   =ENVIZI.HEADERS("location")                          // Returns output headers for location endpoint
   =ENVIZI.HEADERS("stationary", TRUE)                  // Returns input headers for stationary endpoint
   =ENVIZI.HEADERS("stationary", TRUE, TRUE)            // Returns input headers with recommender columns
   =ENVIZI.HEADERS("factor", FALSE)                     // Returns output headers for factor endpoint
   =ENVIZI.HEADERS("recommend_activity_type", FALSE)    // Returns output headers for activity type recommender

**Output**

Returns a single row array containing the header names for the specified endpoint and type (input/output).

**Note on Data Type Recommender**

When ``includeDataTypeRecommender`` is TRUE, the input headers will include three additional columns after "Activity Type":

- **Recommended Activity Type** – AI-suggested activity type based on your description
- **Confidence(%)** – Confidence level of the recommendation (0-100)
- **Description** – Description of the recommended activity type

This is useful when you want to use the ``ENVIZI.RECOMMEND_ACTIVITY_TYPE`` function to get AI suggestions for activity types before performing calculations.

---

Headers by FactorId
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the input or output column headers for factorId-based calculations. Use this when working with factorId instead of type-based parameters.

**Syntax**

**Parameters**

- ``functionName`` *(optional)* – Endpoint name (location, stationary, fugitive, mobile, transportation_and_distribution, calculation, economic_activity, real_estate, factor). Default: calculation
- ``input`` *(optional)* – TRUE for input headers, FALSE for output headers. Default: FALSE

**Note:** The ``factor_search`` endpoint does not support factorId-based calls.

**Examples**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   =ENVIZI.HEADERS_BY_FACTORID("location", TRUE)     // Returns: factorId, value, unit
   =ENVIZI.HEADERS_BY_FACTORID("factor", TRUE)       // Returns: factorId, unit
   =ENVIZI.HEADERS_BY_FACTORID("calculation")        // Returns output headers (same as regular HEADERS)

**Output**

Returns a single row array containing the factorId-based header names for the specified endpoint.
     - Factor ID from Envizi.
